## Prerequisites

This project requires **Node.js 18 or newer** and **Yarn 4.9.2**. Either install these
versions manually or enable `corepack` so that the correct tool versions are
pulled down automatically:

```bash
corepack enable
```

If your environment lacks `corepack`, install Node 18+ and Yarn 4.9.2 directly.
